# PL/0 Compiler

This is a small compiler that was developed with a partner that reads a program written in PL/0. It can process if, procedure, and begin statements. The compiler also shows errors when applicable and can store variables. This compiler also contains a custom parser that I was tasked with developing. This project involved lots of collaboration and effective communication as it involved lots of code. My partner and I are happy with creating an efficient finished product.
